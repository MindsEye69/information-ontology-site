      <h1>Philosophical Context & Influences</h1>
      <p>
        Informational Ontology (IO) is presented as a first‑principles framework rather than a restatement
        of any single existing school. It nonetheless overlaps with several well‑established traditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Relation to Existing Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structural realism:</strong> IO shares the view that relations and structure are prior to objects,
        but derives structure from the more minimal axiom of difference.</li>
        <li><strong>Philosophy of information:</strong> IO treats information as structured difference, not as
        communication, semantics, or Shannon‑style signal theory.</li>
        <li><strong>Process and systems philosophy:</strong> IO aligns with process views while retaining a
        strict axiomatic grounding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        IO should be read as a contribution to this landscape, offering a minimal generative grammar
        rather than a synthesis of existing theories.
