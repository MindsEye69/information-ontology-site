Value establishes differential importance within awareness, but meaning arises when those valued distinctions are organized into coherent patterns that relate present states to other states across time, context, or possibility.

Clarification: Terms such as interpretation, reference, understanding, and anticipation are used here as descriptive correspondences to structural organization, not as semantic primitives."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"Ontologically, meaning refers to the organization of value across possible system transitions. Semantic vocabulary functions as shorthand for these structural relations and does not introduce representational or linguistic commitments beyond what is structurally specified. A system encounters meaning when informational states are not only weighted, but interpreted relative to other valued states—past, anticipated, or counterfactual. Meaning therefore introduces internal reference."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"A given state means something to a system when it stands in an organized relationship to other states that the system values. Meaning is not language-dependent. Linguistic symbols may encode or express meaning, but they do not generate it. Meaning precedes language and is possible wherever values are organized into relational structures that guide interpretation and response. Meaning is likewise not reducible to semantics in the formal sense."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"Formal semantics presupposes meaningful distinctions; it does not explain their origin. In the Informational Ontology, meaning emerges when value constrains awareness in a way that produces internally coherent interpretive patterns.
