Rev 4 Editorial Protocol — v2

Purpose

This protocol defines how Revision 4 of the Informational Ontology (IO) corpus is edited, so that:

There is one canonical text (Rev4_Master).

No older drafts accidentally creep back in.

Terminology and structure remain consistent with the IO chain:
Δ → R → I → A → V → M → P.

1. Single Source of Truth

1.1 Rev4_Master (the compiled document in the word processor) is the only canonical version of the book.
1.2 The website, simulations, notes, and PDFs are derivatives. They may extend, visualize, or explain the ontology, but they must not silently contradict it.
1.3 Any change to the ontology that affects definitions, structure, or the Δ→R→I→A→V→M→P chain must be applied to Rev4_Master first, then propagated outward.

2. Per-Section Editing Workflow

For any change to a specific section of the book:

2.1 User step (offline):

Open the section in the word processor.

Select and copy the current complete text of that section (even if messy).

2.2 User step (chat):

Paste the full section into a fresh turn in the relevant project chat.

State clearly what you want (e.g. “tighten”, “rewrite for clarity”, “add lay sidebars”, “insert diagram spec”).

2.3 Assistant step:

Work only on the pasted text plus project files, not on memory of earlier drafts.

Produce a full revised version of the section and clearly mark it as “Rev4 – Section N – Edited Draft”.

Maintain alignment with the canonical chain and terminology.

2.4 User step (offline):

Paste the revised section back into Rev4_Master, replacing the old version.

Preserve any local formatting that the word processor needs (styles, headings, etc.).

2.5 No partial merges.
Do not try to splice new text into old text within Word by hand unless absolutely necessary. When in doubt, replace the whole section with the new version and only re-insert clearly marked elements (figures, tables) if needed.

3. Special “Global” Tasks

3.1 For tasks that are not single-section edits (e.g. redefining the chain, creating a cross-section gap map, designing the website structure), the assistant may work from:

project files

previous chats

high-level outlines

…without requiring a pasted section.

3.2 However, no global decision is considered final until it is:

reflected in Rev4_Master, and

consistent with the terminology lock (Section 4 of this protocol).

4. Terminology Lock (Δ→R→I→A→V→M→P)

4.1 The canonical IO chain is:

Difference → Relation → Information → Awareness → Value → Meaning → Purpose
Δ → R → I → A → V → M → P

4.2 These names are locked at the ontology level. They must appear as:

Difference (Δ)

Relation (R)

Information (I)

Awareness (A)

Value (V)

Meaning (M)

Purpose (P)

4.3 It is allowed to use interpretive phrases for explanation (e.g. “valuation behaviour”, “practical expression of purpose”), but not as replacements for the stage names.

4.4 Any proposed renaming of a stage is a major revision decision and must:

be explicitly discussed and agreed

be changed everywhere (Rev4_Master, website, diagrams, simulation labels) in a deliberate pass.

5. Website & Repo Synchronisation

5.1 The book text (Rev4_Master) is primary. The website (informationontology.org) is a secondary presentation layer.

5.2 When we update a conceptual component of the ontology (e.g. definition of Value or Purpose), the update order is:

Rev4_Master

Website content (pages, deep dives, start-here path)

Repo notes / README / docs

Diagrams and simulations

5.3 The website is allowed to:

simplify language for lay readers

use analogies and narrative

introduce UI-driven structure

…but it must not alter the canonical meaning of the chain or redefine the stages.

5.4 When editing website copy in chat, clearly label which file/route is being updated (e.g. app/ontology/page.tsx, app/start/value/page.tsx).

6. Diagrams, Sidebars, and Simulations

6.1 Diagrams and sidebars are subordinate to the text, not independent authorities.

6.2 Any diagram describing the chain must label the stages using the canonical names in Section 4.

6.3 Simulations (e.g. Δ→R particle life, etc.) are:

illustrative toys

explicitly analogical

never “proofs” of the ontology

They should always have a short description connecting them to the chain and clarifying their limited scope.

7. Versioning and Safety

7.1 Maintain dated snapshots of Rev4_Master (e.g. Rev4_Master_2025-12-09.docx) before inserting major changes.

7.2 When in doubt about a large edit, create a temporary copy of the section in a separate file and mark it clearly (e.g. S5_experimental_version).

7.3 Never treat a website-only change as canonical until it has been reflected in Rev4_Master.
