📘 Rev 4 Editorial Protocol — v3 (Final)
Informational Ontology Project
0. Purpose of This Protocol

This protocol defines the authoritative workflow for maintaining, updating, and synchronizing all components of the Informational Ontology (IO) project during and after Revision 4.

Its goals are:

To preserve conceptual coherence

To prevent divergence between the text, website, and supporting materials

To maintain a single canonical master document

To ensure safe, reversible editorial practices

To prepare a stable foundation for Revision 5

This document supersedes all prior versions.

1. Canonical Document (“Rev4_Master”)

The sole authoritative version of the ontology during Revision 4 is:

Informational Ontology Rev 4 MASTER.pdf

(uploaded and stored in the project file archive)

This file is the one and only place where conceptual changes originate.

Everything else — the website, diagrams, simulations, documentation — is downstream of this master.

No external source, no website page, and no older file may override it.

2. Update Order (Required)

When any conceptual, terminological, or structural change is made, the following order is mandatory:

1. Rev4_Master

All edits are made here first.

2. Website

Only after the master is updated may changes be propagated into the site:

/app/start
/app/ontology
/app/deep
/app/simulations (descriptions only)

3. Repository Documentation

Update:

README

CONTRIBUTING

CHANGELOG

Terminology reference

Update Protocol (this document)

4. Simulations / Diagrams

Only after textual consistency is achieved.

This prevents conceptual drift and guarantees a single source of truth.

3. Terminology Lock

The IO chain is fixed and canonical:

Δ → R → I → A → V → M → P

Difference → Relation → Information → Awareness → Value → Meaning → Purpose

These stage names may not be altered or replaced except through a future major revision (Revision 5 or later).

Specifically disallowed:

“Valuation” as a stage name

“Practice” as a stage name

Introducing intermediate stages without a formal revision

These terms may appear descriptively, but never structurally.

4. File & Version Management
4.1 Master Document Storage

The canonical Rev4 master file must always reside in the project’s file archive as:

Informational Ontology Rev 4 MASTER.pdf

Do not rename this file during Rev4.

4.2 Backups

When major updates occur, an additional file may be uploaded with:

date stamp or

version suffix (e.g., “Rev4_Master_v1.1.pdf”)

However, the canonical file must always remain:

Informational Ontology Rev 4 MASTER.pdf

4.3 No Parallel Masters

Under no circumstances may a second “master” file coexist.

Older versions must be clearly marked as archives, not active documents.

5. Website Synchronization Protocol
5.1 Scope

After updating Rev4_Master, apply changes to:

/app/ontology

/app/start

/app/deep

Navigation (header/footer)

Metadata (titles, descriptions)

The homepage text

Any downloadable assets

5.2 Deployment Integrity

Every update must satisfy:

All routes build cleanly

No leftover directories (e.g. duplicate stage folders)

Stage progression is sequential and unbroken

No old terminology appears in descriptions

Vercel deployment completes without warnings

5.3 Download Page

The website must provide a download link for:

Rev4_Master PDF

Optional TXT/HTML versions

Diagram packs (once created)

6. Simulation Development Protocol

Simulations illustrate concepts but are not themselves conceptual authorities.

Rules:

Simulations must not introduce new conceptual claims.

Each simulation must explicitly state which IO stage(s) it illustrates.

Simulations must be treated as analogies, not models of ontology.

Simulation descriptions must match Rev4_Master terminology.

No simulation may contradict the canonical document.

Simulations are updated only after Rev4_Master and website text are synchronized.

7. Diagram & Visual Asset Protocol

All diagrams must:

Conform to the Δ→R→I→A→V→M→P structure

Avoid speculative or unapproved conceptual framing

Use consistent coloring and stage symbols

Appear both in the Master Document and on the website

Be version-controlled

Carry a version/date in their metadata (optional but recommended)

Examples include:

IO chain overview

Flow diagrams

Awareness–Value–Meaning model

Purpose trajectory diagram

Observer hierarchy schematic

8. External Contributions Policy
8.1 No Direct GitHub Contributions

External contributors may not:

push branches

open pull requests

modify the master file

8.2 Submission Mechanism

All contribution proposals must be sent via:

contact@informationontology.org

info@informationontology.org
 (technical suggestions)

editor@informationontology.org
 (philosophical submissions)

8.3 Internal Review

Accepted contributions are:

Reviewed against Rev4_Master

Integrated manually

Documented in the CHANGELOG

Synced across site + repo

9. Completion Criteria for Revision 4

Rev4 is complete when ALL of the following are true:

Rev4_Master is finalized and stable.

Website text, navigation, and routes fully match the master.

All diagrams and sidebars are added and synchronized.

Simulations are completed, documented, and linked.

All .md files are updated (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.).

No terminology drift exists anywhere.

Email infrastructure is active.

All historical chats are archived in the project files.

A full deployment is live and verified.

Upon completion, Rev4 becomes the official published edition.

10. Transition to Revision 5

Revision 5 will begin only after Rev4 is fully published.

Rev5 scope includes:

Formal mathematical frameworks

Information-theoretic metrics

Teleology formalization

Cognitive and AI modeling

Category theory grounding

Observer and awareness theory expansion

AI Assistant conceptual framework

Rev5 must begin with a new master document, not an incremental modification of Rev4.

End of Protocol — v3

This is the authoritative editorial policy for the Informational Ontology Project during and after Revision 4.
