For information to arise, relations must exhibit structure. When differences are related in a stable or patterned way, information comes into existence.

Information is not dependent on observers, interpretation, language, or meaning. It does not require minds, symbols, or semantic content."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"Wherever differences are arranged in non-random, relational patterns, information exists. This definition distinguishes informational ontology from purely mathematical, computational, or communicative notions of information. While such frameworks may model or measure information, they do not exhaust its ontological scope. Information is not restricted to human knowledge, digital encoding, or Shannon-style signal transmission. Those are special cases of informational structures, not their source."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"Information becomes structurally unavoidable when relations stabilize into re-identifiable patterns under ordering and selection. Once differences are related, those relations may persist, repeat, or stabilize. The moment relational patterns become distinguishable from mere flux, information is present. No additional ontological primitive is required beyond the structural commitments stated in Section 1. Thus, information is not imposed upon relations from the outside."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"It is generated by relational structure itself. This transition—from relation to information—is denoted as R → I. It marks the emergence of structured existence from mere distinction. Information is not identical to relation.

Relations may be transient, unstructured, or indistinguishable from flux; in such cases, informational structure is not yet established."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"Under persistence and selection, however, patterned relations endure, and it is this endurance of structured difference that constitutes information in the ontological sense. 4.5 Information as the First Structured Mode of Being Information represents the first structured mode of existence.

At this stage, existence acquires form."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed","children":"Information enables persistence by allowing patterns to remain recognizable across change. It enables recursion by allowing informational structures to operate on or reference other informational structures.
