Awareness registers information from a perspective, but without preference, salience, or constraint, all registered information would be equivalent.

Value specifies which differences are favored, avoided, preserved, or suppressed relative to the system’s continued organization. Value therefore introduces constraint. Where awareness opens a field of possible informational states, value shapes that field by biasing transitions within it.

At this stage of the ontology, value is defined solely by its structural role: it constrains the dynamics of awareness.
